## Connection-related
### The server is already installed, but the APP cannot connect
Please try the following:
- Visit (or `curl ip:port/version`) `ip:port/version` in your browser. If it returns the version number, the server is running normally; otherwise, please check the server logs.
- Check if the firewall has released the target port



## Subscription-related
### App Store shows the subscription is successful, but the APP still displays unsubscribed

Please try the following:
1. Restart the APP
2. Disable proxy
3. Restore subscription
